In other words, we run nearest neighbors on the columns of $W$.

If you get an error like \"Expected 2D array, got 1D array instead\" then this is your problem: a column of `W` is technically a 1D array but a column of `X` has dimension $1\\times n$, which is technically a 2D array. You can take a 1D numpy array and add an extra first dimension to it with `array[None]`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Conceptual note 2: as discussed in class, there is a problem here, which is that we're not ignoring the missing entries. You could get around this by optimizing the PCA objective with gradient descent, say using `findMin` from previous assignments. But we're just going to ignore that for now, as the assignment seems long enough as it is (or at least it's hard for me to judge how long it will take because it's new)."

There are 30,000 examples and 24 features, and the goal is to estimate whether a person will default (fail to pay) their credit card bills; this column is labeled \"default payment next month\" in the data. The rest of the columns can be used as features. \n",

    "1. Download the data set and load it in. Since the data comes as an MS Excel file, I suggest using [`pandas.read_excel`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_excel.html) to read it in. See [Lecture 2](https://github.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/CPSC340-2017W-T2/home/blob/master/lectures/L2.ipynb) for an example of using pandas.\n",
    "2. Perform exploratory data analysis on the data set. Include at least two summary statistics and two visualizations that you find useful, and accompany each one with a sentence explaining it.\n",
    "3. Randomly split the data into train, validation, test sets. The validation set will be used for your experiments. The test set should be saved until the end, to make sure you didn't overfit on the validation set. You are welcome to use scikit-learn's [train_test_split](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html), which takes care of both shuffling and splitting. \n",
    "4. Try scikit-learn's [DummyClassifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier.html) as a baseline model.\n",
    "5. Try logistic regression as a first real attempt. Make a plot of train/validation error vs. regularization strength. What’s the lowest validation error you can get?\n",
    "6. Explore the features, which are described on the UCI site. Explore preprocessing the features, in terms of transforming non-numerical variables, feature scaling, change of basis, etc. Did this improve your results?\n",
    "7. Try 3 other models aside from logistic regression, at least one of which is a neural network. Can you beat logistic regression? (For the neural net(s), the simplest choice would probably be to use scikit-learn's [MLPClassifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html), but you are welcome to use any software you wish. )\n",
    "8. Make some attempts to optimize hyperparameters for the models you've tried and summarize your results. In at least one case you should be optimizing multiple hyperparameters for a single model. I won't make it a strict requirement, but I recommend checking out one of the following (the first two are simple scikit-learn tools, the latter two are much more sophisticated algorithms and require installing new packages): \n",

    "  - [scikit-optimize](https://github.com/scikit-optimize/scikit-optimize)\n",
    "9. Explore feature selection for this problem. What are some particularly relevant and irrelevant features? Can you improve on your original logistic regression model if you first remove some irrelevant features?\n",
    "10. Take your best model overall. Train it on the combined train/validation set and run it on the test set once. Does the test error agree fairly well with the validation error from before? Do you think you’ve had issues with optimization bias? Report your final test error directly in your README.md file as well as in your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission format:**\n",
    "Your submission should take the form of a \"report\" that includes both code and an explanation of what you've done. You don't have to include everything you ever tried - it's fine just to have your final code - but it should be reproducible. For example, if you chose your hyperparameters based on some hyperparameter optimization experiment, you should leave in the code for that experiment so that someone else could re-run it and obtain the same hyperparameters, rather than mysteriously just setting the hyperparameters to some (carefully chosen) values in your code.\n",

    "**Assessment:**\n",
    "We plan to grade and fairly leniently. We don't have some secret target accuracy that you need to achieve to get a good grade. You'll be assessed on demonstration of mastery of course topics, clear presentation, and the quality of your analysis and results. For example, if you write something like, \"And then I noticed the model was overfitting, so I decided to stop using regularization\" - then, well, that's not good. If you just have a bunch of code and no text or figures, that's not good. If you do a bunch of sane things and get a lower accuracy than your friend, don't sweat it.\n",

    "**And...**\n",
    "This style of this \"project\" question is different from other assignments. It'll be up to you to decide when you're \"done\" -- in fact, this is one of the hardest parts of real projects. But please don't spend WAY too much time on this... perhaps \"a few hours\" (2-6 hours???) is a good guideline for a typical submission. Of course if you're having fun you're welcome to spend as much time as you want! But, if so, don't do it out of perfectionism... do it because you're learning and enjoying it.\n",
