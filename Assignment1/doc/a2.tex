\section{Naive Bayes}

In this section we'll implement naive Bayes, a very fast classification method that is often surprisingly accurate for text data with simple representations like bag of words.



\subsection{Naive Bayes by Hand}
\rubric{reasoning:3}

Consider the dataset below, which has $10$ training examples and $2$ features:
\[
X = \begin{bmatrix}0 & 1\\1 & 1\\ 0 & 0\\ 1 & 1\\ 1 & 1\\ 0 & 0\\  1 & 0\\  1 & 0\\  1 & 1\\  1 &0\end{bmatrix}, \quad y = \begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\1\\1\\1\\1\\0\\0\\0\\0\end{bmatrix}.
\]
Suppose you believe that a naive Bayes model would be appropriate for this dataset, and you want to classify the following test example:
\[
\hat{x} = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\end{bmatrix}.
\]

\blu{(a) Compute the estimates of the class prior probabilities} (you don't need to show any work):
\items{
\item$ p(y = 1) = \frac{6}{10}$.
\item $p(y = 0) = \frac{4}{10}$.
}

\blu{(b) Compute the estimates of the 4 conditional probabilities required by naive Bayes for this example}  (you don't need to show any work):
\items{
\item $p(x_1 = 1 | y = 1) = \frac{3}{6}$.
\item $p(x_2 = 0 | y = 1)   = \frac{2}{6}$.
\item $p(x_1 = 1 | y = 0) = 1$.
\item $p(x_2 = 0 | y = 0) =  \frac{3}{4}$.
}

\blu{(c) Under the naive Bayes model and your estimates of the above probabilities, what is the most likely label for the test example? (Show your work.)}
\items{
\item $P(x_1 = 1, x_2 = 0 | y = 1) = P(x_1= 1 | y =1 )*P(x_2 = 0 |y = 1) = \frac{1}{6}$
\item $P(x_1 = 1, x_2 = 0 | y = 0) = P(x_1= 1 | y =0 )*P(x_2 = 0 |y = 0) = \frac{3}{4}$
\newline Since the probability of  $P(x_1 = 1, x_2 = 0 | y = 0)$  is higher, the likely label for $\hat{x} = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\end{bmatrix}$ is $y = [0]$
}

\subsection{Bag of Words}
\rubric{reasoning:3}

If you run \texttt{python main.py -q 1.2}, it will load the following dataset:
\enum{
\item $X$: A sparse binary matrix. Each row corresponds to a newsgroup post, and each column corresponds to whether a particular word was used in the post. A value of $1$ means that the word occured in the post.
\item $wordlist$: The set of words that correspond to each column.
\item $y$: A vector with values $1$ through $4$, with the value corresponding to the newsgroup that the post came from.
\item $groupnames$: The names of the four newsgroups.
\item $Xvalidate$ and $yvalidate$: the word lists and newsgroup labels for additional newsgroup posts.
}
\blu{Answer the following}:
\enum{
\item Which word corresponds to column 50 of $X$?
\items{
\item lunar
}
\item Which words are present in training example 500?
\items{
\item car, fact, gun and video
}
\item Which newsgroup name does training example 500 come from?
\items{
\item it comes form group 3, ie 'Sci.*'
}
}
	

\subsection{Naive Bayes Implementation}
\rubric{code:5}

If you run \texttt{python main.py -q 1.3}
it will load the newsgroups dataset and report the test error for a random forest,
and also fit the basic naive Bayes model and report the test error.

The \texttt{predict()} function of the naive Bayes classifier is already implemented.
However, in \texttt{fit()}
the calculation of the variable \texttt{p\_xy} is incorrect
(right now, it just sets all values to $1/2$).
\blu{Modify this function so that \texttt{p\_xy} correctly
computes the conditional probabilities of these values based on the
frequencies in the data set. Hand in your code and the validation error that you obtain.
Also, briefly comment on the accuracy as compared to the random forest and scikit-learn's naive Bayes implementation.}
\items{
\item the implementation is available at avaialble in $ naive\_bayes.py$  file. the validation errors are as follows
\newline Random Forest (sklearn) validation error $: 0.198$.
\newline Naive Bayes (ours) validation error$: 0.315$.
\newline Naive Bayes (sklearn) validation error$: 0.187$.
\newline Surely our implementation of naive bayes is not so accurate as scikit learns implentation because of underflow.the accuracy decreases in our implementation because of floting point multiplication.
}


\subsection{Laplace smoothing}
\rubric{code:1}

\blu{Do the following:}
\enum{
\item Modify your code so that it uses Laplace smoothing, with $\beta$
as a parameter taken in by the constructor.
\items {
\item the code has been implemented in $naive\_bayes.py$ file.
}
\item Did you need to modify your fit function, predict function, or both?
\items{
\item No, we do not have to modiy the fit and predict function.
}
\item Take a look at the documentation for the scikit-learn version of naive Bayes the code is using. How much Laplace smoothing does it use by default? Using the same amount of smoothing with your code, do you get the same results?
\items{
\item the value of beta used was 1. when implemented in our algorithm,we do not get the same result. the error was reduced by 0.04.
}
}


\subsection{Runtime of Naive Bayes for Discrete Data} 
\rubric{reasoning:3}

Assume you have the following setup:
\items{
\item The training set has $n$ objects each with $d$ features.
\item The test set has $t$ objects with $d$ features.
\item Each feature can have up to $c$ discrete values (you can assume $c \leq n$).
\item There are $k$ class labels (you can assume $k \leq n$)
}
You can implement the training phase of a naive Bayes classifier in this setup in $O(nd)$, since you only need to do a constant amount of work for each $X(i,j)$ value. (You do not have to actually implement it in this way for the previous question, but you should think about how this could be done). \blu{What is the cost of classifying $t$ test examples with the model?}
\items {
\item Answer: \bf {the cost of classifying t examples is $O(dt)$}
}

\section{Random Forests}

\subsection{Implementation}
\rubric{reasoning:7}

The file \emph{vowels.pkl} contains a supervised learning dataset where we are trying to predict which of the 11 ``steady-state'' English vowels that a speaker is trying to pronounce.

You are provided with a \texttt{RandomStump} class that differs from
\texttt{DecisionStump} in two ways: it uses the information gain splitting criterion
(instead of classification accuracy), and
it only considers $\lfloor \sqrt{d} \rfloor$ randomly-chosen features.\footnote{The notation $\lfloor x\rfloor$ means the ``floor'' of $x$, or ``$x$ rounded down''. You can compute this with \texttt{np.floor(x)} or \texttt{math.floor(x)}.}
You are also provided with a \texttt{RandomTree} class that is exactly the same as
\texttt{DecisionTree} except that it uses \texttt{RandomStump} instead of
\texttt{DecisionStump} and it takes a bootstrap sample of the data before fitting.
In other words, \texttt{RandomTree} is the entity we discussed in class, which
makes up a random forest.

If you run \texttt{python main.py -q 2} it will fit a deep \texttt{DecisionTree}
using the information gain splitting criterion. You will notice that the model overfits badly.





\enum{
\blu {\item Why doesn't the random tree model have a training error of 0?}
\items {
\item the random tree model does not have a training error of zero because of its infinite depth. the error gets propogated in the tree due to its infinite depth and therefore is not zero.
}
\blu {\item Create a class \texttt{RandomForest} in a file called \texttt{random\string_forest.py} that takes in hyperparameters \texttt{num\string_trees} and \texttt{max\string_depth} and
fits \texttt{num\string_trees} random trees each with maximum depth \texttt{max\string_depth}. For prediction, have all trees predict and then take the mode.}
\items {
\item \bf { the implemetation is available in $random\_forests.py$.}
}
\blu {\item Using 50 trees, and a max depth of $\infty$, report the training and testing error. Compare this to what we got with a single \texttt{DecisionTree} and with a single \texttt{RandomTree}. Are the results what you expected? Discuss.}
\items {
\item the training and testing errors are as follows.
\newline  Decision tree info gain
    Training error: 0.000,
    Testing error: 0.367 .
 \newline Random tree info gain
    Training error: 1.000,
    Testing error: 1.000 .
 \newline Random forest info gain
Training error: 0.532,
    Testing error: 0.682 .
\newline the results are not as expected. the error value obtained by our implementation is higher than other classifier menthods.}
\blu {\item Compare your implementation with scikit-learn's \texttt{RandomForestClassifier} for both speed and accuracy, and briefly discuss. You can use all default hyperparameters if you wish, or you can try changing them.}
\items{
\item the training and test error with scikit-learns implemetnation is as follows.
\newline Random forest info classifier  gain, more trees
    Training error: 0.000,
    Testing error: 0.159 .}
}

\subsection{Very-Short Answer Questions}
\rubric{reasoning:3}

\enum{
\item What is a a disadvantage of using a very-large number of trees in a random forest classifier?
\items{
\item the runtime  increases as the number of trees increases.
}
\item Your random forest classifier has a training error of 0 and a very high test error. Which ones of the following could help performance?
\enum{
\item Increase the maximum depth of the trees in your forest.
\item Decrease the maximum depth of the trees in your forest.
\item Increase the amout of data you consider for each tree (Collect more data and use $2n$ objects instead of $n$).
\item Decrease the amount of data you consider for each tree (Use $0.8n$ objects instead of $n$).
\item Increase the number of features you consider for each tree.
\item Decrease the number of features you consider for each tree.
}
\items{
\item \bf{(c) increase the amount of data you consider for each tree.}
\item \bf{(e)Increase the number of features you consider for each tree.}
}
\item Suppose that you were training on raw audio segments and trying to recognize vowel sounds. What could you do to encourage the final classifier to be invariant to translation?
\items{
\item we can train the classifier on data that has been obtianed by transalating the original data to a certain extent. this can make the classifier translation invariant.
}
}


\section{Clustering}

If you run \verb|python main.py -q 3|, it will load a dataset with two features
and a very obvious clustering structure. It will then apply the $k$-means algorithm
with a random initialization. The result of applying the
algorithm will thus depend on the randomization, but a typical run might look like this:
\centerfig{.5}{../figs/kmeans_basic.png}
(Note that the colours are arbitrary -- this is the label switching issue.)
But the `correct' clustering (that was used to make the data) is this:
\centerfig{.5}{../figs/kmeans_good.png}


\subsection{Selecting among $k$-means Initializations}
\rubric{reasoning:5}

If you run the demo several times, it will find different clusterings. To select among clusterings for a \emph{fixed} value of $k$, one strategy is to minimize the sum of squared distances between examples $x_i$ and their means $w_{y_i}$,
\[
f(w_1,w_2,\dots,w_k,y_1,y_2,\dots,y_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n \norm{x_i - w_{y_i}}_2^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^d (x_{ij} - w_{y_ij})^2.
\]
 where $y_i$ is the index of the closest mean to $x_i$. This is a natural criterion because the steps of $k$-means alternately optimize this objective function in terms of the $w_c$ and the $y_i$ values.

 {\enum{
 \item In the \emph{kmeans.py} file, add a new function called \emph{error} that takes the same input as the \emph{predict} function but that returns the value of this above objective function. Hand in your code.
\items{
\item the error fucntion has been implemented in $kmeans.py$ file.
}
 \item What trend do you observe if you print the value of \emph{error} after each iteration of the $k$-means algorithm?
\items{
\item the error decreases with each iteration.
}
 \item Using \texttt{plot\_2dclustering}, output the clustering obtained by running $k$-means 50 times (with $k=4$) and taking the one with the lowest error.
\items{
\item Below is the plot with the lowest error. \centerfig {.5}{../figs/kmeans_3_1_3.png}
}
 \item Looking at the hyperparameters of scikit-learn's \texttt{KMeans}, explain the first four (\texttt{n\_clusters}, \texttt{init}, \texttt{n\_init}, \texttt{max\_iter}) very briefly.
 }
\items{
\item \texttt{n\_clusters:}It tells the number of centroids to generate and number of clusters to form.
\item \texttt{init:} It is the  method uded for initialization, can be either Kmeans$++$, ndarray or random
\item\texttt{n\_init:} it is a representation of the times the kmeans algrithm will run with different centroid seeds.
\item \texttt{max\_iter:} It represents the maximum number of iteration of Kmeans algorithm in a single run.
}



 \subsection{Selecting $k$ in $k$-means}
\rubric{reasoning:5}

 We now turn to the task of choosing the number of clusters $k$.

 {\enum{
 \item Explain why the \emph{error} function should not be used to choose $k$.
\items{
\item we cannot select k on the basis of the error because error is based on distance. it is possible to reach a value of K where the distance becomes zero, which is not useful.
}
 \item Explain why even evaluating the \emph{error} function on test data still wouldn't be a suitable approach to choosing $k$.
\items{
\item Even on test data, the algorithm will choose the value of K so as to minimize the value or error(distance). we get the same result as above.
}
 \item Hand in a plot of the minimum error found across 50 random initializations, as a function of $k$, taking $k$ from $1$ to $10$.
\items{
\item Below is the plot with lowest error with  k = 8. It was obtained by running the algorithm 50 times with random initialization and k varying from 1 to 10. \centerfig{.5}{../figs/kmeans_3_2_3.png}
}
 \item The \emph{elbow method} for choosing $k$ consists of looking at the above plot and visually trying to choose the $k$ that
 makes the sharpest ``elbow" (the biggest change in slope). What values of $k$ might be reasonable according to this method? Note: there is not a single correct answer here; it is somewhat open to interpretation and there is a range of reasonable answers.
 }
\items{ 
\item The value of K I beleive is resonable 3. \centerfig{.5}{../figs/q3_2_4_tree_errors.pdf}
}

 \subsection{$k$-medians}
\rubric{reasoning:5}

 The data in \emph{clusterData2.pkl} is the exact same as the above data, except it has 4 outliers that are very far away from the data.

 {\enum{
 \item Using the \texttt{plot\_2dclustering} function, output the clustering obtained by running $k$-means 50 times (with $k=4$)  and taking the one with the lowest error. Are you satisfied with the result?
\items{
\item Below is the plot with the lowest error obtained by running kmeans 50 times and $k = 4$.  \centerfig{.5}{../figs/kmeans_3_3_1.png}
}
 \item What values of $k$ might be chosen by the elbow method for this dataset?
\items{
\item I beleive that K should be 3. \centerfig{.5}{../figs/q3_3_2errors.pdf}
}
 \item Implement the $k$-\emph{medians} algorithm, which assigns examples to the nearest $w_c$ in the L1-norm and to updates the $w_c$ by setting them to the ``median" of the points assigned to the cluster (we define the $d$-dimensional median as the concatenation of the median of the points along each dimension). Hand in your code and plot obtained with 50 random initializations for $k = 4$.
\items{
\item the code was implemented in kmeadians.py file and below is the plot with the lowest error obtained with 50 random initializations and $k = 4$.
\centerfig{.5}{../figs/kmedians_3_3_3.png}
}
\item Using the L1-norm version of the error (where $y_i$ now represents the closest median in the L1-norm),
\[
f(w_1,w_2,\dots,w_k,y_1,y_2,\dots,y_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n \norm{x_i - w_{y_i}}_1 = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^d |x_{ij} - w_{y_ij}|,
\]
what value of $k$ would be chosen by the elbow method under this strategy? Are you satisfied with this result?
\items{
\item the value of k should be 3. \centerfig{.5}{../figs/q3_3_4medians_errors.pdf}
}
}


\subsection{Density-Based Clustering}
\rubric{reasoning:2}

If you run \texttt{python main.py -q 3.4},
it will apply the basic density-based clustering algorithm to the dataset from the previous part.
The final output should look somewhat like this:\\
\fig{.49}{../figs/density}\fig{.49}{../figs/density2}\\
(The right plot is zoomed in to show the non-outlier part of the data.)
Even though we know that each object was generated from one of four clusters (and we have 4 outliers),
 the algorithm finds 6 clusters and does not assign some of the original non-outlier
  objects to any cluster. However, the clusters will change if we change the parameters
  of the algorithm. Find and report values for the two
  parameters, \texttt{eps} (which we called the ``radius'' in class) and \texttt{minPts},
   such that the density-based clustering method finds:
{\enum{
\item The 4 ``true" clusters.
\items{
\item eps = 2.5  and minpts = 6 \centerfig{.5}{../figs/clusterdata_dbscan_4clusters.png}
}
\item 3 clusters (merging the top two, which also seems like a reasonable interpretaition).
\items{
\item eps = 6  and minpts = 3 \centerfig{.5}{../figs/clusterdata_dbscan_3clusters.png}
}
\item 2 clusters.
\items{
\item eps = 13  and minpts = 3 \centerfig{.5}{../figs/clusterdata_dbscan_2clusters.png}
}
\item 1 cluster (consisting of the non-outlier points).
\items{
\item eps = 0.1  and minpts = 5 \centerfig{.5}{../figs/clusterdata_dbscan_1cluster.png}
}
}


\subsection{Very-Short Answer Questions}
\rubric{reasoning:3}

{
\enum{
\item Does the standard $k$-means clustering algorithm always yield the optimal clustering solution for a given $k$?
\items{
\item No, the optimal clustering solution is not quaranteed always.
}
\item If your set out to minimize the distance between each point and its mean in a $k$-means clustering, what value of $k$ minimizes this cost? Is this value useful?
\items{
\item Minimizing the distance is not a useful approach as when k is same as the number of samples, the value of distance reaches zero. Instead,the plot of the mean distance to the centroid as a function of k can be used as a rough estimate to determine  k.
}
\item Describe a dataset with $k$ clusters where $k$-means would not be able to find the true clusters.
\items{
\item Kmeans fails when there are concentric clusters of data and it sometimes creates clusters even in uniformly distributed data.
}
\item Suppose that you had only two features and that they have very-different scales (like kilograms vs. milligrams). How would this affect the result of density-based clustering?
\items{
\item It becomes difficult to choose an appropriate e if features have very-different scales. this would distort the clustering to an extent.
}
\item Name a key advantage and drawback of using a supervised outlier detection method rather than an unsupervised method?
\items{
\item the advantage is that we can detect complicated outlier patterns, but the disadvantage is that it can only detect known outlier patterns.
}
}



\section{Vector Quantization}
\rubric{reasoning:6}

Discovering object groups is one motivation for clustering. Another motivation is \emph{vector quantization}, where we find a prototype point for each cluster and replace points in the cluster by their prototype. If our inputs are images, vector quantization gives us a rudimentary image compression algorithm.

Your task is to implement image quantization in \emph{quantize\_image.py} with \texttt{quantize} and \texttt{dequantize} functions. The \texttt{quantize} function should take in an image and, using the pixels as examples and the 3 colour channels as features, run $k$-means clustering on the data with $2^b$ clusters for some hyperparameter $b$. The code should store the cluster means and return the cluster assignments. The \texttt{dequantize} function should return a version of the image (the same size as the original) where each pixel's orignal colour is replaced with the nearest prototype colour.

To understand why this is compression, consider the original image space. Say the image can take on the values $0,1,\ldots,254,255$ in each colour channel. Since $2^8=256$ this means we need 8 bits to represent each colour channel, for a total of 24 bits per pixel. Using our method, we are restricting each pixel to only take on one of $2^b$ colour values. In other words, we are compressing each pixel from a 24-bit colour representation to a $b$-bit colour representation by picking the $2^b$ prototype colours that are ``most representative'' given the content of the image. So, for example, if $b=6$ then we have 4x compression.

The loaded image contains a 3D-array representing the RGB values of a picture.
\blu{Implement the \emph{quantize} and \emph{dequantize} functions and show the image
obtained if you encode the colours using $1$, $2$, $4$, and $6$ bits with the provided image.}
You are welcome to use the provided implementation of $k$-means or the scikit-learn version.


\enum{
\item Hand in your \emph{quantizeImage} and \emph{deQuantizeImage} functions.
\items{
\item the code has been implemented in quantize\_image.py file.
}
\item Show the image obtained if you encode the colours using $1$, $2$, $4$, and $6$ bits per pixel (instead of the original 24-bits).
\item Briefly comment on the prototype colours learned in case each, which are saved by the code.
}
